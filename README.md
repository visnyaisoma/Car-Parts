# Car-Parts
Car parts browser in python.

This simple project contains a .txt file. Each row of this file lists a car part, which may consist of one or more words.
The goal of the program is to demonstrate the functionality of a basic keylogger in Python. 
Using the keylogger, the program stores the pressed keys in a list. 
It then attempts to find and return the longest match from the carparts.txt file, even if the car part is typed as a substring.
